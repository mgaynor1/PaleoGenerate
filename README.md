# PaleoGenerate

## Introduction  

High-resolution paleoclimatic datasets are broadly applicable to investigating drivers of contemporary biodiversity patterns. Generation of paleoclimatic layers is often done with proprietary software, which greatly limits new applications, particularly for those without advanced GIS skills. Here, we provide a completely open source-based approach to infer robust paleoclimatic layers, specifically annual mean temperature (bio1), for 50 distinct time segments between 0 and 3.3 MYA. In addition, we generate layers for five additional bioclimatic variables: temperature seasonality (bio4), annual precipitation (bio12), precipitation of wettest month (bio13), precipitation of driest month (bio14), and precipitation seasonality (bio15). 

PaleoGenerate is an R project used to generate Bioclim variables at time between 0 and 3.3 million years ago (MYA). This method is based on [Gamisch, 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geb.12979) and utilizes [PaleoClim layers](http://paleoclim.org/). 

| Variable |  |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| BIO1 | Annual Mean Temperature |
| BIO4 | Temperature Seasonality |
| BIO12 | Annual Precipitation |
| BIO13 | Precipitation of Wettest Month |
| BIO14 | Precipitation of Driest Month |
| BIO15 | Precipitation Seasonality |

## Set-up
Locally, I set up an [R project](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects). This is where I generated the input files for PaleoGenerate and tested the functions.

Input data files obtained PaleoClim included the following:

| Name | Age |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Current | 1979 â€“ 2013, marked as 0 Mya |
| Pleistocene: Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) | ca. 21 ka |
| Pleistocene: MIS19 | ca. 787 ka |
| Pliocene: mid-Pliocene warm period (Mid) | 3.264-3.025 Mya, set as equal to 3.264 Mya|
| Pliocene: M2 | ca. 3.3 Mya |



## Generating Input files for PaleoGenerate
The **.R** R file generates raster stacks for each desired bioclim variable using layer files for 0 to 3.3 million years ago (MYA) obtained from [PaleoClim layers](http://paleoclim.org/). All layers were cropped to the extent of 180 E, 180 W, 0 N, and 90 N - this decreased run time.
